	<h1>Carbon Emission Zoetrope!</h1>
  	<p>
    My team and I created a zoetrope to raise awareness for better modes of transportation.

		In order to sort out our thoughts, we created a model to show the root causes of carbon emission. Since our time was limited, we chose to focus on one of the subtopics: Need to travel. 
		Though, we can't magically change everyone's lives to no longer need transportation, we are able to make a projectt that displays better ways to do so.
