	<h1>Carbon Emission Zoetrope!</h1>
  	<p>
    My team and I created a zoetrope to raise awareness for better modes of transportation. 
</p>
	
	  
	  <h2>Cause and Effect Model</h2>
	<img src="Cause and Effect Model.png" alt="Cause and Effect Model">
	<p> 
		In order to sort out our thoughts, we created a model to show the root causes of carbon emission. Since our time was limited, we chose to focus on one of the subtopics: Need to travel. 
		Though, we can't magically change everyone's lives to no longer need transportation, we are able to make a project that displays better ways to do so. </p>
	 
	  
	  <h2>Our Story Board</h2>
	  <img src="Story Board Animation.png" alt="Story Board">
	  <p> This is a shortened version of our real zoetrope story board, but it conveys our main points. For the first act/disc (top row), there is a man who witnesses a car expelling gas into the air as it enters and leaves the frame. Then in our second act/disc (bottom row), there is another man who witnesses a bike that does the same thing, just without the carbon gas emission. </p>

	  <p> As you can see, we stuck to the general idea of the bike entering and leaving the frame, with a person witnessing. After this picture was taken, I added text ("Wow") above the scene to indicate the man's enjoyment with the fact that the bike did not pollute our air.</p>
	  
	  <h2> Our Mechanism and Code </h2>

	  <img src="Template Works.png" alt="Template fits!">
	 
	  <p> After cutting out the template Mr.Sinusas provided for our zoetrope, we had to make sure that it had enough support. So, we added another layer of cardstock behind the originial template. Due to the additional layer of thickness, we had to double check that it still fit. (After a few sessions of trouble shooting) It worked! </p>

	  <img src="Attaching Mechanism.png" alt="Attaching Mechanism">
	  <p> We needed something to actually spin our zoetrope, so we used a coded motor to do so. The code had to be easily adjustable, so that we wouldn't have to rewrite the code every 5 seconds when tweaking the mechanism. After smoothing over the kinks in the code, we worked on attaching the zoetrope. But, on the last day we had to change our attachment because we had to add structure to our discs which interfered with the attachment mechanism. </p>
	  

<h2> Our Characters </h2>

	  <img src="Cricut Designing.png" alt="Cricut Character Designs">
	  <p> To start off, my team thought that we were going to use clay figures-whom we named Steve- for our zoetrope. But after assessing our situation of a zoetrope, we opted against it, for it would just take way too much time. Instead, we decided to focus on using the cricut machine for all of our characters/designs. </p>
