	<h1>Carbon Emission Zoetrope!</h1>
  	<p>
    My team and I created a zoetrope to raise awareness for better modes of transportation. 
</p>
	
	  
	  <h2>Cause and Effect Model</h2>
	<img src="Cause and Effect Model.png" alt="Cause and Effect Model">
	<p> 
		In order to sort out our thoughts, we created a model to show the root causes of carbon emission. Since our time was limited, we chose to focus on one of the subtopics: Need to travel. 
		Though, we can't magically change everyone's lives to no longer need transportation, we are able to make a project that displays better ways to do so. </p>
	 
	  
	  <h2>Our Story Board</h2>
	  <img src="Story Board Animation.png" alt="Story Board">
	  <p> This is a shortened version of our real zoetrope story board, but it conveys our main points. For the first act/disc (top row), there is a man who witnesses a car expelling gas into the air as it enters and leaves the frame. Then in our second act/disc (bottom row), there is another man who witnesses a bike that does the same thing, just without the carbon gas emission. </p>
	  <img src="Bike Zoetrope.png" alt="Bike Zoetrope Final">
	  <p> As you can see, we stuck to the general idea of the bike entering and leaving the frame, with a person witnessing. After this picture was taken, I added text ("Wow") above the scene to indicate the man's enjoyment with the fact that the bike did not pollute our air.</p>
